## Who would win?

A fun little app that lets you pit two random characters against each other and vote on who would win in a fight.
I was trying vibe coding so the code maybe a bit bad.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
